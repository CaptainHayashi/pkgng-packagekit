.Nd return PackageKit category for a pkgng port origin
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar origin
.\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a debug utility for investigating the mapping between ports directories and 
PackageKit categories as part of the PackageKit pkgng backend.
It returns the descriptive name of the category that matches the directory of
the port origin given on the command line.
.Pp
.Ar origin
is expected to be a package origin, that is a port category directory followed
by a slash and then a port name.  For the purposes of
.Nm
the actual port/package name may be empty, but the slash must always exist.
.Pp
The result is always written on one line to standard output.

.Sh BUGS
If the backend cannot find a match for a port directory, it will return
.Ql unknown
instead.  This includes the case in which a directory has been supplied without
a trailing slash.
