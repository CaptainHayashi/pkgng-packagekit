PackageKit backend for pkgng
http://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2013/pkgPackagekit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a PackageKit backend for the FreeBSD pkgng package manager.

It is licenced under the GNU General Public License version 2+ (this is because
it links to PackageKit itself, which is under this licence).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS

- PackageKit (currently building against version 0.6.11; the code MAY work with
  versions 0.7.x but WILL NOT YET work with 0.8.x due to API incompatibilities)
- pkgng (currently building against version 1.1.3; higher versions might work)
- FreeBSD (tested with 9.1; should work with higher versions)
- For the tests, atf (devel/atf) is needed to compile and run the unit tests.

Tested primarily with clang in C11 mode and GCC in GNU99 mode.
C89 and normal C99 mode will not work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPILING

This backend currently builds using the BSD make system.  Using GNU Make (gmake)
will *not* work.  (Porting to GNU Autotools is an exercise for the reader.)

To compile and install the backend:
  - Ensure you have the correct versions of PackageKit and pkgng installed as
    directed above.
  - Run `make`, or some variation thereon, in the 'backend' directory.
    (I prefer to run `scan-build --use-cc=clang33 make` with WARNS=7 set, but
    this involves clang33 being installed.)
  - Run `make install` as root to install the backend into PackageKit's backends
    directory.
  - If you have ATF/kyua installed, run `make tests` to create the tests.
  - Edit /usr/local/PackageKit/PackageKit.conf such that "DefaultBackend=pkgng"
    (or manually invoke packagekitd with backend=pkgng).

One can also use the Makefile in the root directory; this will build the
backend as well as any utilities and tests included with it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TESTING

The backend has ATF unit tests.  To run these:
  - Install ATF or kyua (should be in FreeBSD ports);
  - Run `make tests` in the backend directory;
  - Run `atf-run | atf-report` in the backend, backend/query and backend/jobs
    directories.

There are also some functional tests, in the form of shell scripts, scattered
in the tests/ directory.  Generally these will require you to use the test
repo (which is currently down and needs recreating--TODO!).
Make sure PackageKit is using pkgng as its backend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNOWN BUGS

- Behaviour when a repository has multiple versions of a package is currently
  ill-defined (the first one in the iterator will be emitted).  This requires
  further work. 
- Minor cosmetic issues (progress bars not updating properly, etc.) may exist.
- Some options to actions (recursion in GetDetails, repo signing requirements,
  etc) are not yet implemented.
- Cancel is not implemented.
